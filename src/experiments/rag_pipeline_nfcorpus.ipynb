While some studies suggest that statins may decrease the risk of breast cancer, others have found no significant association or even potential harmful effects. To better understand this relationship, a meta-analysis was conducted which combined data from multiple observational studies. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis, and cumulative analyses were also performed, but no clear conclusion could be drawn. Additionally, a population-based case-control study and a large cohort study both found no significant association between statin use and breast cancer risk. Therefore, the current evidence does not support the claim that statin drugs cause breast cancer.'"

Additionally, following a diet rich in polyphenols may also help decrease exposure to other environmental contaminants, such as antibiotics and phthalates, which can be inadvertently consumed through food.

These include selecting patients carefully and using low-dose techniques, such as digital sensors and collimation, to minimize exposure. However, a recent study suggests a potential link between dental x-rays and brain tumors, highlighting the importance of informed decision making and proper communication of risks to patients. Overall, while the risk of developing cancer from diagnostic radiation is low, it is important for dentists to follow recommended protocols and for patients to be fully informed about the potential risks.'"
